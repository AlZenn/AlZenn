### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zeynep (AlZenn) and I am currently pursuing my studies in Turkey. My area of specialization is in game development, with a keen interest in game programming.

Over the course of my experience, I have had the opportunity to work with several game engines such as Unreal Engine (2022-Ongoing), Unity (2020-Ongoing), and GDevelop (2017-2018). In addition to this, I am well-versed in programming languages such as C# and Java.
